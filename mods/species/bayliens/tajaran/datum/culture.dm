	description = "Hrarar are the most numerous tajaran ethnicity on Meralar, and were the most heavily represented tajarans \
	in the diplomatic delegations that dealt with humans through the early post-contact years. This led to a fairly entrenched \
	image of the Hrarar as the \"average\" tajaran among humans and their other interstellar neighbours. Many Hrararan cultures \
	are based on strong traditions and ideals, and the patchwork of nations and city-states that make up their lands often \
	infight on matters of honour and religious one-upmanship."
